INSTRUCTIONS
1. Select the level you would like to play from the start menu.
2. Gameplay levels will not begin until a key is pressed, so press any key to begin playing once you are on a gameplay screen / level.
3. The four arrows keys correspond to the four buttons, as indicated visually by the facing direcion of the falling arrows. Pressing an arrow key will activate the corresponding button.
4. Try to hit the falling arrows / notes when the overlap with the buttons by pressing the corresponding arrow key on the keyboard.
5. Hitting notes will score points, and more precise hits will score more points. 
6. Hitting several consecutive notes will increase the points earned by hitting notes.
7. Hitting enough consecutive notes will cause you to start gaining health for every note hit, but will also increase the speed of the falling notes.
8. Missing notes means not getting those points, and losing a point of health. If the game speed is above the standard speed due to a high combo score, it will also derease the game speed, until it is back to the default speed.
9. Once a song ends, the End Screen will appear, displaying various gameplay statistics and giving the options to proceed to the next level, return to the Start Menu, or Quit the game.
